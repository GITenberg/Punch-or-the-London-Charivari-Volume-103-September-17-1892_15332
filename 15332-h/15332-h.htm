<h2>HEARING HIMSELF.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Mysterious Mem. from a Hawarden Note-Book.</i>)</h4>

<p>Exceedingly kind and flattering of MAX MÜLLER! "I hope there
are but few here present who have never enjoyed the privilege of
listening to Mr. GLADSTONE." Ha! ha! He little thought there
was <i>one</i> there who had <i>not</i> "enjoyed that privilege." Have enjoyed
most privileges in my time, but never that of "hearing myself as
others hear me"&mdash;more or less. "Unavoidable absence of Mr.
GLADSTONE!" Ho! ho! Then my disguise <i>was</i> perfect. Get myself
up as a Liberal Unionist, with wig and eye-glass. Not likely anybody would recognise
me in <i>that</i> rig.</p>

<p>Rather enjoyed myself&mdash;and my paper, "Ph&oelig;nician Elements in the Homeric
Poems." Most seductive title! Such a <i>popular</i> touch about
it! Think I shall have it printed as a "leaflet" for distribution among Workmen's
Clubs and Radical Associations. Might conciliate those well-meaning but illogical
Eight-Hour Men. Wonder if KEIRHARDIE would like a copy. What more
nicely calculated to cheer the scant leisure of Labour?</p>

<p>Funny to hear my own sinuous sentences coming back to me from mouth of another.
Not quite sure MAX is so "fascinating in his voice, and so persuasive
in his delivery" as&mdash;but no matter. Can't say&mdash;as MAX did&mdash;"I felt myself
carried away, and convinced almost against my will." Not at all! Wonder what he
meant by that? Why "against his will"? That's what Liberal Unionists, and other
preposterous and illogical opponents of mine say in House, when they compliment
me on my "eloquence," <i>and then vote against me!</i> Absurd! Wish they'd
drop their compliments and vote straight.</p>

<p>"Small and exotic contribution" to Oriental Congress! Neat description of paper
running to nearly four
columns of <i>Times</i>. "Intense sentiment of nationality, which led
the Greeks of later days to covet the title of Autochthones." Wonder
if that reminded MAX, or anyone else, of <i>another</i> race with "an
intense sentiment of nationality," and a passionate love of the land
from which they sprang. Wonder whether, if Nationalists were
to call themselves "Auctochthones" instead of Home-Rulers, we
should get along better? Must consult JUSTIN on this point.
Should have to teach some of them to <i>pronounce</i> their new name,
though. "Autochthones," spoken in wrath, with a rich brogue, after
dinner, would, I should think, beat Phillippopolis, or "Ri' l'il, ti'
li'l Isl'l" hollow.</p>

<p><i>Anax andr&#333;n</i>, too, might be useful. Say, as substitute for that
everlasting G.O.M., of which I admit I'm heartily sick, Lord of
Men! <i>Not</i> King of Men, of course. LABBY might kick at latter.
"Nothing can be simpler than the meaning of the two words."
Exactly. Must get HARCOURT to popularise these. Applied to
AGAMEMNON. Why not to "strong men" who live <i>after</i> AGAMEMNON?
"Evidence from extraneous sources of connection between
title of <i>Anax andr&#333;n</i> and great Egyptian Empire." Aha! I may yet
have to play the <i>Anax andr&#333;n</i> in Egypt as before. Allegory&mdash;I mean
<i>Anax andr&#333;n</i> on banks of Nile! Good&mdash;and not a Malapropism,
whatever WOLSELEY may say. "Title of <i>Anax andr&#333;n</i> descendible"
(good word, "descendible") "from father to son, and accorded in
the poems to personages altogether secondary, <i>viz.</i>, EUMELOS and
EUPHETES." Wonder what my EUMELOS&mdash;HERBERT&mdash;will say to that!</p>

<p>Enjoyed it much whilst MAX was "mouthing out" (as Mrs.
BROWNING says) my eulogy of that man of "Ph&oelig;nician stamp,"
the "universal ODYSSEUS," who expressed the many-sided, the all-accomplished man;
the <i>polutropos</i>, the
<i>polumetis</i>, the <i>tlemon</i>,
the <i>polutlas</i>, the <i>polumekanos</i>, the <i>poikilometis</i>,
the <i>poluphron</i>,
the <i>daïphron</i>, the <i>talasiphron.</i> (What a peck of p's!) In battle
never foiled! In council supreme! His oratory like the snow-flakes of the winter
storm. Superbly representative Ph&oelig;nician! "But over and above this universality
of ODYSSEUS in the arts of life, he bears the Ph&oelig;nician stamp
in what may be termed his craft." Aha! The "Old Parliamentary Hand" of his period
plainly. Wonder if MAX thought of <i>that</i>! Hellas and Ph&oelig;nicia combined! As a
Statesman of classical culture, commercial instincts <i>and</i> craft,
what a shining success ODYSSEUS might have been in these days!</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>He went into the Cyclops' cave</p>
<p class="i2">To see what he could spy out;</p>
<p>He slew his oxen, stole his sheep,</p>
<p class="i2">And then he poked his eye out,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>as the ribald doggerelist has it. Sounds a little "predatory," perhaps, as SALISBURY
would say. But quite capable of being "spiritualised" into a sound Liberal policy,
directed against the purblind Poluphemos of Property and Privilege.</p>

<p>On the whole, I had a high old time among
the Orientalists. But when discussion ensued, I longed to throw off
my disguise and rush, Achilles-like, into the fray. But MAX might
have thought that inconsistent with my "colossal humanity;" so,
very unwillingly, I refrained.</p>

<hr />

<p>UP ALOFT.&mdash;The most elevated title in the Peerage, and belonging
to the upperest part of the Upper House, is "Lord MOUNTGARRET."
There can be but one higher, and that will have to be created in the
person of a future "Lord TOPOCHIMNEPOT." Though, perhaps, the
title of "Lord COWLEY," if it were altered into Lord CHIMNEPOT-COWL-Y,
would be the highest of all.</p>

<h2>INNS AND OUTS.</h2>

<h3 class="sc">No. III.&mdash;The Porter.</h3>

<p>I had intended to have written, this week about "Loggosh"&mdash;including that mysterious
canvass hand-box which contains all that a foreigner cares to carry about with
him by day, and often pillows him when travelling by night; but the very
mention of luggage brings me back to the Porter. I abominate him. I am "one
who has suffered." So here goes!</p>

<p>"Imposing," best describes the Hôtel porter; a very Grand Hôtel has at
least two of these impositions&mdash;the House Porter and the Omnibus Porter. The
latter you only see twice in your Hôtel existence, but he is the most futile and the
deadliest fraud of the two.</p>

<p>This Porter is part and
parcel of that horrible deep-red-plush nuisance, the Hôtel-omnibus. He and it
are inseparables, and make up a sort of Centaur between them. Once outside the
Railway-station, I am besieged by a babel of these Porter-omnibuses&mdash;"Bear
Hôtel, Sor;" "Grand Hôtel, Sor!"&mdash;This, from a very dilapidated specimen, which,
on inspection, turns out to be "Grand Hôtel Du Lac;" a pirate porter-omnibus in
fact; at last I find <i>The</i> Grand Hôtel vehicle, and functionary. The latter is
of gigantic stature; quite a
"chucker-out;" in a uniform between that of a German bandsman
and a Salvation Captain&mdash;"Certinly, Sar. Dis Grand Hôtel; I see
your Loggosh, Sar; gif me se empfangschein." "Do you speak
English?" I retort.&mdash;"Certinly; spik Ingleese&mdash;empfangschein!"&mdash;"Empfangschein"
baffles me, and I am about to hand my keys to
the monster, when a good-natured Courier explains that it signifies
the luggage-receipt.</p>

<p>Away ambles the Porter, leaving me with that orphaned sort of
feeling which a luggageless Englishman experiences; it is pouring
cats and dogs; I am dead beat; I creep into the dark omnibus. I
find myself quite alone. I wait impatiently&mdash;a quarter of an hour&mdash;twenty-five
minutes&mdash;still no Porter; I am famished; to distract
myself, I peer through the door, whence I can discern the messy
vista of the railway-station in the rain; it's lucky I do so; for there
I behold my own portmanteau, with its huge purple stripe, being
hauled away on the back of a railway-man, followed by an alien
Hôtel Porter, <i>not mine</i>, doing nothing: they are always doing
nothing. To rush out indignantly, seize my box, defy the brigands,
and carry it back myself, seemed the work of an instant. Drenched
and gasping, I find myself once more outside; the Porter of the
Grand Hôtel Du Lac is at my heels, furious and impertinent. "Dis,
<i>not</i> your loggosh: other shentleman's loggosh." He seized the portmanteau,
and a struggle would certainly have ensued, when my own
Hôtel Porter appeared on the scene triumphant, with a regiment of
station-men carrying one small tin box. "What you do, Sar; see
<i>here</i>, your loggosh!" The tin box belonged to a commercial-traveller,
who was bound for the Hôtel Du Lac.</p>

<p>I am too exhausted to curse, and leave the rival Porters to
fight it out themselves, after paying off the ragged regiment of
Station-men. On the drive to the Hôtel, the Porter tries to propitiate me.</p>

<p>"Pity shentlemans like you, Sar, fetch de loggosh. I tell you,
better leave it to me, Sar. You see, <i>I</i> get your loggosh. Dat bizley
Porter of De Hôtel Du Lac, he change de empfangschein; but I
sweep it from him, and bring to de 'Bus"&mdash;"'Bus" was good&mdash;and then he laughed!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:55%;"><a href="images/122.png"><img width="100%" src="images/122.png" alt="'Pity shentlemans like you, Sar, retchistar de loggosh.'" /></a>"Pity shentlemans like you, Sar, retchistar de loggosh."</div>

<p>I never saw the brute again until the time of my departure;
I had taken a carriage to the Station this time, thinking thereby to
avoid the Porter-omnibus. I had registered my traps myself, and
was looking out for some one to carry them to the den in which
you are penned till the train arrives, when, lo! the chucker-out!
smiling and bowing as if he had never seen me before&mdash;"Is
better I retchistar de loggosh, Sar; pity shentlemans like you, Sar,
retchistar de loggosh."</p>

<p>I turn on my heel with
an imprecation which "Ingleese-spikers" understand. But he still waits there,
smiling, and expecting to be tipped, Let him wait. So much for the Omnibus-Porter&mdash;at
once the Gamp and Undertaker of my Grand Hôtel existence.</p>

<p>The House-Porter is of equal size, and equal uselessness. He sits in the
hall, and always rises and salutes when you pass. If you want anything, he
waits till you have got it, and then offers to procure it for you. If you ask to
be called early, he chalks something on a slate, and you are safe not to be disturbed
until you rise in your wrath and ring violently. Should you be in
a town, and wish to secure theatre-tickets, he becomes more active; he implores
you not to resort to "De Boxing Office, vare you pay premiums, you see;" but
he has one or two left for sale. Should you be weak enough to yield, you will
find that the worst seats at the highest prices are yours; and, if you remonstrate
next day, he will sigh wearily, and remark,&mdash;"Is acheslant places, Sar; but
was Gala Night, you see,"&mdash;an enigma, which those
who run may read. He is always offering to do something, and
doing <i>you</i> instead. He is absolutely unnecessary, for there is
seldom anyone in a Grand Hôtel to "chuck out," and this would
be his only justification.</p>

<h2>THE "BLOWER" BURST UP!</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The "Blower" came down, like the braggart he was,</p>
<p>And of winning the fight was peculiarly "poz;"</p>
<p>And the voice of his backers was loud in their glee;&mdash;</p>
<p>"We shall lick him in two rounds&mdash;or certainly three!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Like the "Champion Slugger," in trunks of bright green,</p>
<p>The "Big Fellow" at Eight fifty-two might be seen:</p>
<p>Like a truculent Titan, blind, baffled, and blown,</p>
<p>At Ten thirty-seven the brute was o'erthrown.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>For CORBETT smote fiercely, and CORBETT fought fast,</p>
<p>And the bullying bounder was beaten at last;</p>
<p>And the cheeks of the coarse woman-puncher were chill,</p>
<p>He rolled over, and struggled to rise, and lay still.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And there stood his foe with his nostrils all wide,</p>
<p>And the shouts of his backers rolled on in their pride.</p>
<p>The swells of the Ring and the stars of the Turf</p>
<p>Surged round like the waves of the storm-beaten surf.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And there lay the "Blower," distorted and pale,</p>
<p>With the blood on his brow where the blows fell like hail.</p>
<p><i>His</i> backers were silent, he lay there alone,</p>
<p>His mawleys unlifted, his trumpet unblown.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And the "Sports" of the South are all loud in their wail.</p>
<p>But <i>Punch</i>, who hates bullying brutes, can but hail</p>
<p>That smart Californian's pluck, skill, and strength,</p>
<p>Who has pricked the big SULLIVAN bladder&mdash;at length!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<hr />

<p>"FONS ET ORIGO."&mdash;As to London Water "seek Wells," that is
if you wish to avoid unpleasant seq-uels. "<i>Don't</i> leave Wells
alone" is our motto, meaning "Sir SPENCER" of that ilk, who has a
deal worth hearing to say on this subject.</p>

<h2>A ROUNDABOUT RAMBLE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Fact Founded on Fiction.</i>)</h4>

<p>The sharp, bright little Traveller made his way to the Cabinet of
M. CARNOT, and disturbed him at work.</p>

<p>"Do you know, M. Le Président," said he, "that the Russians
are in secret treaty with the English, and the Russo-French Alliance
is all nonsense&mdash;the most unreliable of broken reeds?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," replied CARNOT, "I have not heard anything of the
sort; and, if anyone should be up in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Traveller did not want to hear the rest, for he was once
again on his road, telling everyone he met the disquieting intelligence,
and, consequently, the French people were greatly troubled.</p>

<p>He was soon in Berlin. He did not ask for an interview with the KAISER, but took one.</p>

<p>"Your Royal and Imperial Majesty," said he, "are you aware
that Italy is in secret accord with France, and that the Triple Alliance
is a sham, and that the cry <i>À Berlin!</i> may be renewed at any moment?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said the Emperor, "I have not heard this; and if
anyone should know anything about it, I fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Traveller did not wait for the KAISER to finish the sentence,
but was off again, telling everyone he met the disquieting
intelligence. And, consequently, the German people were greatly troubled.</p>

<p>Then the Traveller obtained admission, in the same unceremonious
fashion, to the apartment occupied by the Emperor of AUSTRIA.</p>

<p>"King of HUNGARY," said he, "are you aware that you cannot
possibly rely upon your German neighbour, because the KAISER has
a secret understanding with the CZAR, by which the Principalities
will be included in Russian territory, and the Rhine secured from French invasion?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not heard it," was the answer; "and, if it had
been the case, I imagine that&mdash;"</p>

<p>But again the Traveller left without waiting for the completion of
the sentence, and went his way telling everyone he met the disquieting
intelligence. And consequently, the Austro-Hungarian peoples were greatly troubled.</p>

<p>And now the Traveller was in the presence of the Emperor of ALL
THE RUSSIAS. Again he had obtained admission without the preliminary
of an official introduction.</p>

<p>"Little Father," said the Traveller, "are you aware that your
youthful relative in Berlin is coquetting with France and England,
and you may find the whole of Europe marshalled against you?"</p>

<p>"Well, no I have not heard it," returned the CZAR; "and I really think&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Traveller never learned what the CZAR really thought, for
he was away before His Imperial Majesty had completed the sentence.
And as he went away, after his usual fashion, he spread the
disquieting intelligence, and consequently the Russian people were greatly troubled.</p>

<p>And now the Traveller was in Cairo. He presented himself before
the KHEDIVE without waiting for the English adviser.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, do you know that the British Army of occupation
is on the eve of departure?" said he.</p>

<p>"What, in spite of Lord ROSEBERY going to the Foreign Office!"
exclaimed the SULTAN's vassal, in a tone of considerable astonishment.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the visitor. "Everything was settled long
ago, and before Christmas there won't be a red-coat in Egypt!"</p>

<p>"Indeed," returned His Highness, "I certainly have not heard it, and I fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Traveller departed without ascertaining the drift of the
KHEDIVE's fancies, and on his road, strictly according to precedent,
spread the disquieting intelligence, and consequently the Egyptian
people were greatly troubled.</p>

<p>And now the Traveller was once more back in London. He entered
Capel Court and rested himself. He said nothing. It was unnecessary,
for he was well known, and his stories had already been discounted.</p>

<p>"Ah, my little friend RUMOUR," said Mr. BULLBEAR; "you have
come back again! And now you can rest for awhile, until we want
you after the next account."</p>

<p>So RUMOUR is waiting in the Stock Exchange until he is wanted after the next account!</p>

<h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

<h3>No. XIV.&mdash;TO SWAGGER.</h3>

<p>I approach you with fear and trembling. Somewhere in the Cave
of the Winds you have your home. The ancient Authors, to their
discredit, make no mention of your existence there, but the fact is
as I have stated it. The East wind blows into your gaping mouth,
and forth you go, puffing and swelling with an alien importance, to
do your hateful work. You hover over a second-rate Statesman,
who has attracted the applause of a Party by an opportune speech,
compiled by the industry of a humble Secretary. From that
moment his nature changes. Though he may have been simple and
beloved, yet, through you, he shall become pompous, and abhorred.
His fellow-creatures are thenceforth mere material for his trampling
feet; he swells into regions to which no criticism can reach; he
covers himself in a triple hide of vanity, ostentation,
and disdain; he hails himself continually
as the unaided Saviour of his country, and
dies in the odour of braggadocio, without a genuine friend to mourn his loss.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:28%;"><a href="images/124.png"><img width="100%" src="images/124.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>Or, again, you select some common, smug-faced
Clergyman, capable, no doubt, if he were left
alone, of guiding his flock quietly into the strait
paths of goodness and humility. You turn him
into a loud-voiced Clerical quack, vending his
wretched patent medicines of salvation in a
style of offensive denunciation that would have
ruined a host of Dulcamaras, trained in the
insinuating methods of the ordinary trade. But
on this the Clergyman thrives, and weak women
fall prostrate before his roaring insincerity.</p>

<p>Nor do you neglect the young. Heavens! I
remember I was once favoured with the confidences
of WILLIAM JOSKINS BACON, an Undergraduate,
generally known to his intimates as
"Side of Bacon." I shudder to recollect how
that amazing creature discoursed to me about
his popularity, his influence, his surprising
deeds both of valour and of discretion. With
one nod&mdash;and, as he spoke, he gave me an illustration
of his Olympian method&mdash;he had awed
his Head-master&mdash;a present ornament of the
Bench of Bishops&mdash;into a terrified silence, from
which he recovered only to bless the name of
JOSKINS, and hold him up as a pattern to his
schoolfellows. At a single phrase of scorn from
those redoubtable lips, his College Tutor had
withered into acquiescence, and had never dared
to refuse him an <i>exeat</i> from that day forth. "I
can't help pitying the beggar," said JOSKINS&mdash;"but
I had to do it. You must make these
fellows feel you're their master, or they'll never
give you a moment's peace. Halloa!" he
continued, as a brawny athlete sauntered into the room, "how's
the boat going, BULLEN? Not very well, eh? Well, remember I'm
ready to lend you a hand, and pull you through when things get
desperate." The smile with which this offer was received had no
effect upon my companion. He took it rather as a tribute to the
subtle humour which, as he believed, lay lurking in his simplest
utterances. "Always make 'em laugh," he observed, with pride.
"It keeps up the spirits of these poor devils of rowing-men; and old
BULLEN knows I'm all there when I'm wanted." But I had heard
enough, and departed from him, feeling as though a steam-roller
had passed over my moral nature, and flattened out my self-respect.</p>

<p>Then there was CHEPSTOWE, the poet. I am old enough to remember
him; and it pleases me sometimes to call back to my mind
this paltry and forgotten little literary <i>Bombastes</i>. As I write, I
have before me some of the reviews that greeted his boisterous invasion
of the regions of song. "Mr. CHEPSTOWE," said one, "has
struck a note which is destined to vibrate so long as the English
language is spoken in civilised lands. He is no ordinary rhymester,
struggling feebly in the bonds of convention. With a bold and
masterful on-rush, he cleaves his way unhesitatingly to the very
heart of things, tears it out, and lays it, palpitating and bleeding,
before the eyes of humanity. We have only space for a few lines
from the magnificent <i>Ode to Actuality</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Prone in the caverns of the vasty deep</p>
<p class="i10">I lay,</p>
<p>And slept not, though I seemed to sleep.</p>
<p class="i10">The day</p>
<p>Pierced not with sullen eyes of pallid scorn</p>
<p class="i10">The dark,</p>
<p>Unplumbed abyss, where, girt with red limbs torn.</p>
<p class="i10">The shark</p>
<p>Sported, and eyeless monsters crawled in slime&mdash;'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"No extract can, however, convey an adequate idea of this grand
poem, on which, as on the bed rock, Mr. CHEPSTOWE's fame is
established for ever, SHAKSPEARE himself might have been proud
to have written it." I may remark, parenthetically, that in
his "Ode" CHEPSTOWE pictured himself as a sort of animate skeleton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Sockets where light once shone grinned emptiness;</p>
<p class="i10">The teeth</p>
<p>Were fallen from the gaping, gumless jaws; nathless</p>
<p class="i10">Beneath</p>
<p>The cold smooth skull, the brain retained her throne."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Amid these uncomfortable surroundings CHEPSTOWE described
himself as penetrated with raptures of fierce joy at having shaken
himself free from the world and its puling insincerities to dwell
amid "Unpitying shapes of death's dread twin despair," where
"Rapine and slaughter raged, and none rebuked." Another reviewer
observed that "The soul of ARCHER's,
the tavern-brawler's glorious victim, KIT MARLOWE,
has taken again a habitation of clay.
She speaks trumpet-tongued by the mouth of
Mr. CHEPSTOWE. We note in these outpourings
of dramatic passion an audacity, an energy,
an enthusiasm, that are calculated to shake
Peckham Rye to its centre, and make Balham
tremble in its ridiculous carpet slippers. Who&mdash;to
take only one example&mdash;but Mr. CHEPSTOWE or MARLOWE could have written thus
of 'Rapture'?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'Not in the mouths of prating men who deem</p>
<p>That God dwells in the senseless clay they mould,</p>
<p>Who live their little lives and die their deaths,</p>
<p>Lapped in a smug respectability;</p>
<p>Who never dreamt of breaking puny laws</p>
<p>Formed for a puny race of grovellers;</p>
<p>But in the blood-stained track of flaming swords,</p>
<p>Wielded by knotty arms in Man's despite,</p>
<p>Or on the wings of crashing battle-balls,</p>
<p>Bone-shattering dealers of a thousand wounds,</p>
<p>The roaring heralds of indignant God,</p>
<p>There rapture dwells, and there I too would dwell.'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Here is power that would furnish forth a whole
legion of the poetasters who crawl through our
effete literature!" But I cannot pursue these
memories. They are too painful. For who
speaks of CHEPSTOWE now? Who cares to
cumber his bookshelves with the volumes in
which this inflated arm-chair prophet of the
tin pots delivered his shrieking message? His
very name has flickered out; and when I spoke
of him the other day, I was asked, by a person
of some intelligence, if I referred to CHEPSTOWE
who had just made 166 playing cricket for the
Gentlemen against the Players. Not even the
lion and the lizard keep his courts, and yet
JAMSHYD CHEPSTOWE gloried and drank deep in his day. He blustered
through many editions, he bellowed his contempt at a shrinking
world, he outraged conventionality, he swung himself by the aid of
newly-fashioned metres to lofty peaks of poetic daring, and to-day
the dust lies thick upon his books, and his name is confounded with
that of an eminent cricket-player!</p>

<p>My excellent SWAGGER, it was meanly done. If you meant to
wipe him out so swiftly, why did you ever exalt him?</p>

<p>Farewell for a space. I may have to write to you again.</p>

<p>"USED UP."&mdash;Lord BRASSEY requested several papers last week
to publish his denial as to having the finest collection of stamps in
the world. His Lordship, it appears, "doesn't take the smallest interest
in foreign stamps." Fortunate for Lord BRASSEY. There are
some excellent people who can't get up any interest, or capital either,
at all without a stamp of some sort. Lord BRASSEY wished it further
known, that he was not a collector of curios, and had no curiosity of
any kind. Lord BRASSEY must be a later edition of <i>L'Homme Blasé</i>,
to whom the world was round like an indiarubber-ball and "nothing in it."</p>

the aspect of the heavens by daylight will be as delightful and
artistic as are the walls of our hoardings and Railway-stations.
The anthem of "<i>The Heavens are Telling</i>" will have to be adapted
for large towns. Perhaps pictures may be projected on the nebulous
back-ground. If so, some of our best Artists may not object to
taking a good sum, and then having their work "Sky'd."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Some years ago a babe was born&mdash;I need not name the place&mdash;</p>
<p>With a puffy, pasty, podgy, gutta-percha sort of face,</p>
<p>Which wrinkles sub-divided into funny little bits,</p>
<p>While beady eyes peered cunningly behind two tiny slits.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>His nose was like a mushroom of the foreign button sort,</p>
<p>His form was quaint and chubby, and his legs were extra short;</p>
<p>That his nurse spoke like SAPPHIRA, I have always had a fear,</p>
<p>When she said he was a "beauty," and a "pretty little dear."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yes, such remarks were really of the truth, a dreadful stretch,</p>
<p>For, in point of fact, that baby was a hideous little wretch;</p>
<p>And in course of time he grew up&mdash;though a loving mother's joy&mdash;</p>
<p>Into quite a champion specimen of the genius "ugly boy."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At school his teasing comrades gave him many comic names,</p>
<p>And he became the victim of all sorts of naughty games;</p>
<p>Nor did the master like him, for he felt that such a face,</p>
<p>Mid a row of ruddy youngsters, was extremely out of place.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In time, his father placed him in the City&mdash;as a clerk&mdash;</p>
<p>Where his personal appearance excited much remark;</p>
<p>But he fell out with his principal, whose customers complained,</p>
<p>That his clerk was making faces, and said "Bosh!" when he explained.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>On perceiving from the office that he never would be missed,</p>
<p>As Mr. GILBERT puts it, he determined to enlist;</p>
<p>And so one summer afternoon he started forth in search</p>
<p>Of a Sergeant who perambulates close by St. Martin's Church.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The Sergeant burst out laughing when he'd uttered his request,</p>
<p>And declared that, of a batch of jokes he knew, this was the best;</p>
<p>"'Tis a pity you're too short, my lad," he then went on to say,</p>
<p>"For wid <i>that</i> face ye'd froighten ivery inimy away!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In a fountain which played handy&mdash;it was near Trafalgar Square&mdash;</p>
<p>He was rushing off to drown himself, the victim of despair,</p>
<p>When he knocked against a person he'd not seen for quite an age,</p>
<p>Who had left his home some years before, and gone upon the Stage.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>To this friend he soon narrated his distressing tale of woe,</p>
<p>And declared his case was hopeless. But the actor said, "Not so.</p>
<p>There's <i>one</i> thing, my fine fellow, that as yet you haven't tried,</p>
<p>Where your face will be your fortune, and a pound or two beside.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"With a mouth like yours to grin with, and your too delicious squint,</p>
<p>And the ears that Nature's given you with such a lack of stint,&mdash;</p>
<p>No matter what an author may provide you with to speak,</p>
<p>You're a ready-made Comedian&mdash;with your fifty quid a week."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And it was so. Though he started at a figure rather less</p>
<p>Than the one that I have mentioned, still the truth I but express</p>
<p>When I say he now is earning such a wage as wouldn't shock</p>
<p>A respectable Archbishop or a fashionable jock.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And the face that all men sneered at, now is very much admired,</p>
<p>And the public ne'er, apparently, of watching it grows tired,</p>
<p>And the Merchant who dismissed him, in the Stalls is wont to sit,</p>
<p>While the Sergeant and his sweetheart are applauding from the Pit.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The moral of my narrative is easy to espy.</p>
<p>But still I'd better mention it, lest some should pass it by:</p>
<p>"Though it's often very troublesome indeed to find it out&mdash;</p>
<p>There's a proper sphere for <i>everyone</i>, beyond the slightest doubt."</p>

<p class="author">HUGH ADOLPHUS LATCH-KEY.</p>

<p><i>Sept</i>. 5, 1892.</p>

<p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;The reason (which I confide to your ear, and yours alone)
is obvious&mdash;the girls don't,
and apparently <i>won't</i> propose.
Of course they ought&mdash;what else do we have Leap Year for? Take my
own case. I am genuinely in love with ETHEL TRINKERTON, who has just been
staying with us in the country for three weeks. She has paid me every kind
of attention. In our neighbourhood, if A. carries B.'s umbrella, where A. and B.
are of opposite sexes, it is regarded as an informal, though perfectly definite
way of announcing an approaching engagement. She knew the custom, and <i>carried
mine on no less than three occasions</i>. (It is entirely beside the point
that it rained heavily each time.) Yet she left us yesterday without an approach
to a proposal. She's fair enough herself, but is her conduct? It isn't
as if I hadn't given her enough chances. It cost me a small fortune
to bribe my small brother to keep away; and, time after time, I've
consented to sit alone with her in the summer-house. It isn't as if
she couldn't afford it. They tell me she has at least a thousand
a-year in her own right (whatever that may be), which would do
capitally. I happen to be penniless myself; but, as I heard her
say, her idea of marriage was the union of "soul to soul," my
want of a few paltry pence could hardly matter. It's particularly
humiliating for me, as, after the repeated umbrella-carrying,
everybody here thinks it's all settled. That, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, is the
reason why, at any rate, <i>one</i> young man doesn't marry.</p>

<p class="author">Yours, thoroughly aggrieved,<br />
BERTIE COOL-CHEEK,</p>

<p><i>Pickleton-in-the-Marsh, Kent</i>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If ETHEL really didn't understand her position, and would
like to reopen the matter, I would not be haughty about it.&mdash;B. C-C.</p>

<p>DEAR, KIND, GOOD MR. PUNCH,&mdash;The reason is obvious&mdash;the men
don't and won't propose to the right girls. Take my own case. I've
just stayed three weeks with the COOL-CHEEKS, and felt quite certain
BERTIE would have proposed. He had all the symptoms badly. I
saw him give his little brother half-a-crown to go indoors for ten
minutes, and the way he <i>would</i> go in the summer-house and for long
walks&mdash;with <i>me</i>&mdash;made it quite clear (as I thought) what was going
to happen. Yet, he let me come away without a word! I'm sure <i>I</i>
don't want to run after him (or anybody else), but I <i>did</i> think he
meant something. We suited one another admirably. In fact, if he
doesn't ask <i>me</i> with all the opportunities he had, he'd ask no one.</p>

<p class="author">Yours, just-a-little-disappointed,<br />
ETHEL TRINKERTON,</p>

<p><i>The Thorns, Bayswater.</i></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;He carried my umbrella almost hourly&mdash;and you know what
<i>that</i> means. If BERTIE was only nervous, and would like another
chance&mdash;well, we are always at home on Sunday afternoons.&mdash;E.T.</p>

it if you thought it would do. You can put it in whenever you like;

<h2>"THE GRATUITOUS OPINION."</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Story for the Long Vacation</i>.)</h4>

<p>The Eminent Lawyer was about to return to his private address,
when there was a knock at the door of his Chambers. He attended to
the summons himself, and found facing him an elderly and carefully
dressed individual.</p>

<p>"That some of my suburban neighbours desire the information,
must be my excuse for troubling you," said the visitor.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not apologise," returned the Eminent Q.C., "it is my
pleasantest duty to give legal tips or applications to anybody. It is
not altogether lucrative, as I deliver them for nothing, but then on
the other hand, they are suitable for insertion in the papers, and
that is a comforting consideration. What can I do for you?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/130-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/130-2.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>"I have to ask you on behalf of my suburban neighbours," continued
the visitor, "whether there
is any principle which is accepted by
Judges to regulate their decisions in
cases where drunkenness seems to be the incentive of crime?"</p>

<p>"I shall only be too glad to find
a solution to a problem which appears one of great difficulty&mdash;the
more especially as certain inhabitants of the suburbs are so deeply
interested in the subject. It seems to me that some Judges think one
way and some another."</p>

<p>"That is strange," murmured the visitor. "Cannot their Lordships
come to a common conclusion?"</p>

<p>"I fear not," replied the Eminent
Counsel, with a mournful smile. "It is merely a question of opinion.
However, I take it that one
would be perfectly safe to commit a murder under the influence of
<i>delirium tremens</i>."</p>

<p>"I am infinitely obliged to you for the information," said the
visitor, "as now I know what to do."</p>

<p>"You are not homicidal, I trust!" exclaimed the Lawyer, jumping
up from his chair, and taking protection behind a desk.
"I have the greatest possible objection to homicidal clients."</p>

<p>"Be under no apprehension," was the reply. "I have a strong
desire to shorten the life of a certain person, but have not the nerve
to do it. If I ever succeed, will it be a case deserving capital punishment?"</p>

<p>The Lawyer pondered a moment, and then replied.
"I have no wish to offer my counsel; but, as you have exhausted
my time for consideration, I would propose that you should try the
matter for yourself. Become intoxicated, put yourself within the
clutches of the law, and then see whether his Lordship will assume the black cap."</p>

<p>"You are very good," returned the would-be homicide, "but I have
one difficulty. When I make up my mind to remove a person by
unconventional means (for choice, a carving-knife), and consume the
necessary amount of alcohol to insure intoxication&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interjected the Lawyer, who had now opened the outer door.</p>

<p>"I find, on reaching intoxication, that I have entirely forgotten the
identity of the man I have marked for my victim. Then I have got to
grow sober before I can remember who it is. Annoying, isn't it?"</p>

<p>And, wishing the Eminent Counsel
a pleasant holiday, the visitor disappeared into the Inner Temple.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
